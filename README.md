## Hey there!

If you're on this page you've followed a link on either an application or my portfolio site. Or maybe I linked something somewhere like on Dev.to. Anyway, hello! Feel free to browse around my hobby code projects. I tend to work on them more often in the winter when Fargo is too cold for outdoor/garage projects. Staying warm and cozy with some code is better than shoveling snow in high winds ☕

#### The last project I started...
🏁 **Track Simulator, a UWP desktop project for uplifting the timing system at a local drag strip.** The old one is a less-than-pleasant user experience and troubleshooting is a royal pain, so after using it for half a decade I wanted to take a shot at what my own version would be like. I'm self-taught when it comes to UWP so having a project to tinker on is fun.

#### I'm passionate about...
👩‍💻 **Writing code that's easy to understand, maintain, and upgrade.** I started my career being thrown into a huge legacy system, so I learned the importance of structuring and designing projects with the future in mind...and how miserable it turns out when you don't.

#### I'm curious about...
📱 **Django + Python.** I've done stuff for industrial settings with PTC's Thingworx, but having more customized apps using something like Django and Python looks interesting to learn. So far I haven't done a ton with it beyond tutorials, and previously I've done system support for .NET apps, but I haven't created a Django app myself yet. As long as a project does cool stuff, I'm down to learn additional platforms and skills. Just please don't make me do COBOL again.

#### What on earth is that GitHub profile picture?
🚘 My car! I love that little thing <3
